title: Proof of Stake (PoS) is nonsense
categories: [Bitcoin]

I suspect many let their social/green conscience cloud their view of PoW, lowering their security standards and commitment towards the hard computer sciences. PoW does not (nor should it) know where the electricity is sourced. Electricity is in abundance worldwide, much of it clean and stranded. Geography is not an issue for bitcoin.  

PoS is just nonsense full stop. It favours existing money and does not incentivise new innovations. It also opens up a whole new world of complex human incentivisation structures that have yet to be fully explored. PoS certainly has no place in the world of hard monies.

PoW favours the entrepreneur, innovation and change. Keep up or be left behind.
