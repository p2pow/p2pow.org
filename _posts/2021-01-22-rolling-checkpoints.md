Rolling checkpoints is security theatre. It's all relative to where the node sits on the network graph. Chaos would ensue if there were was ever sustained contention at the fork tip, with nodes all over the world "locking" themselves to random checkpoints. Proof of social media would be required for everyone to "agree" on a valid "checkpoint", with all nodes having to manually roll back.

BCH no longer follows the "longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone".
